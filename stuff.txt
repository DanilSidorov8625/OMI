What you listed (üëç do these)
* Redis
    * Use RedisStore for express-rate-limit.
    * 10‚Äì20s TTL cache for /api/grid rectangles.
    * (Later) Pub/Sub channel to fan out new_image across multiple nodes.
* Testing
    * Vitest + Supertest for routes; Playwright for one happy-path upload; autocannon smoke on /api/grid.
* Make app.js prod
    * Bundle/minify (Vite), defer load, self-host /socket.io/socket.io.js, keep CSP strict, set long cache headers.
    * Default client logger to low-noise (debug off, sampling down).
* Mobile gestures
    * Pinch-zoom + two-finger pan via Pointer Events; touch-action: none on canvas.
Add these tiny ops bits (keeps you safe)
* TLS & proxy: run behind Caddy/NGINX; enable gzip/brotli; HTTP‚ÜíHTTPS redirect.
* Monitoring: uptime check + alert (Healthcheck/BetterStack); tail logs; a basic dashboard for error rate/429s.
* Backups: nightly copy of instance/grid.db; R2 lifecycle (transition/orphan cleanup policy).
* Secrets/env: .env only in deploy; rotate keys; NODE_ENV=production.
* CI/CD: GitHub Action for npm ci, lint, tests ‚Üí build ‚Üí deploy.
* Security: weekly npm audit, dependabot, lockfile; keep Helmet rules you have.
* Readiness/health: you have /health; add a simple /ready if you add Redis (checks PING).
‚ÄúDone‚Äù definition
* Load test passes at your target RPS with <200ms p95 on /api/grid.
* No client console errors in a clean session.
* Rate limiting works (no 429 storms during normal use).
* Backups running; restore tested once.
* One mobile pinch/pan test passes on iOS + Android.
